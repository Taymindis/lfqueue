*"...After a long time of doubts, opposition, and preparation of this feature, WG21 agreed on how the coroutines should look like and it’s very likely that coroutines will come into C++ 20. Since it’s a big feature I think it’s good to start preparing and learning this now (remember there are also modules, concepts, and ranges in the to learn list )..."* -- [Dawid Pilarski](https://blog.panicsoftware.com/about-me/)

*"...Coroutines are not Threads..."* -- [Dusan Jovanovic](https://dusanjovanovic.org/)

Pretty good intro on co routines: [CppCon 2016: James McNellis “Introduction to C++ Coroutines"](https://youtu.be/ZTqHjjm86Bw)

For detailed, alas necessary "micro course"for the ones needing to "go deep":

1. ### [COROUTINES INTRODUCTION](https://blog.panicsoftware.com/coroutines-introduction/)
2. ### [YOUR FIRST COROUTINE](https://blog.panicsoftware.com/your-first-coroutine/)
   - this is about how one would implement his/her own [`promise`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/promise) type. Please just "observe" on first read. Or skipe enitrely as this is not a required level, from an "regular developer".
4. ### [CO_AWAITING COROUTINES](https://blog.panicsoftware.com/co_awaiting-coroutines/)
